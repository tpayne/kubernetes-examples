StatefulSet Sample
==================

This repo contains an example which shows how to do StatefulSets using Kubernetes.

StatefulSets are used to maintain machine names and IP addressed between pod restarts.

Dependencies
------------
Before you attempt this example, please ensure you have done the following: -
- You have installed the Kubernetes client (kubectl) and Postgres client (psql)
- You have logged into a (Unix) terminal window that will allow you to do deployments to a valid K8s cluster
- You have setup the PSQL environment (e.g. `% . ./pg_env.sh`)
- You have your Kubernetes' context set to a system that you have permission to deploy to

Note: These solutions have only been tested with Kubernetes server `version 1.19.7`. 

Running the Example
-------------------
This solution uses Kubernete's StatefulSets to maintain a PSQL installation.

To run this solution please do the following steps.

You only need to do this first step if you are changing your Kubernetes configuration...

    % kubectl config get-contexts
    % kubectl config use-context <default>
    % kubectl config current-context
    
Once you have setup the client to point to the desired Kubernetes server, please run the following...

    % kubectl delete all --all -n logicapp-db; kubectl delete namespace logicapp-db; \
        kubectl delete pv postgres-01; kubectl delete pv postgres-02; \
        kubectl delete sc localstorage; \
        kubectl create -f stateful-sets.yaml
    % kubectl get all -n logicapp-db

If everything has worked as expected, then this will generate output like the following...

    mac:LoadBalancer bob$ kubectl get all -n logicapp-db
    NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/postgres-container-0   1/1     Running   0          8m13s
    pod/postgres-container-1   1/1     Running   0          8m12s

    NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
    service/postgres   LoadBalancer   10.0.251.102   52.149.199.93   5432:31889/TCP   8m14s

    NAME                                  READY   AGE
    statefulset.apps/postgres-container   2/2     8m14s

To show the solution, use the EXTERNAL_IP shown above run the following command...

    % psql -h 52.149.199.93 -U postgres
    Password for user postgres: 
    psql (13.2)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# \l
                                     List of databases
        Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges   
    ------------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
     postgres   | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
     postgresdb | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
     template0  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
                |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
     template1  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
                |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
    (4 rows)

    postgres=# \c postgresdb
    You are now connected to database "postgresdb" as user "postgres".
    postgresdb=# create table test (col1 char(25), col2 char(25));
    CREATE TABLE
    postgresdb=# \d test
                       Table "public.test"
     Column |     Type      | Collation | Nullable | Default 
    --------+---------------+-----------+----------+---------
     col1   | character(25) |           |          | 
     col2   | character(25) |           |          | 

    postgresdb=# \q

Cleaning Up
-----------
To clean up the installation, do the following...

    % kubectl delete all --all -n logicapp-db; kubectl delete namespace logicapp-db; \
        kubectl delete pv postgres-01; kubectl delete pv postgres-02; \
        kubectl delete sc localstorage
        
This will delete all the items created in your Kubernetes installation.
