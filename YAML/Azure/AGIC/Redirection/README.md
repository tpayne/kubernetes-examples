AGIC Samples
============

This repo has a couple of example Kubernetes deployment YAML files that show how to use the
new Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller.

At the time of writing these samples, the AGIC was a bit flaky, so the samples are not overly
complicated and use override annotations that in other circumstances you might not want to use.

(Note: These solutions are primarily intended for Kubernetes server `1.22+ only`. They have not been
vetted on earlier versions and use later network APIs which might not be available on previous versions).

Dependencies
------------
Before you attempt this example, please ensure you have done the following: -
- You have installed Helm (helm) and the Kubernetes client (kubectl)
- You have logged into a (Unix) terminal window that will allow you to do deployments to a valid K8s cluster
- You have your Kubernetes' context set to a system that you have permission to deploy to
- You have access to an Azure account as an admin (or have permission to create clusters and deployments)

Running the samples
-------------------
To run the samples, please do the following steps.

First, install the cluster and the controller...

    ./deploycontroller.sh

Once you have deployed the controller, you can install some basic examples...

    ./deployingress.sh
    ./deploycontroller.sh --getIp

These examples will show how the IC functionality works. You can try them by doing...

    curl <gatewayIp>/apicmd/version
    curl "<gatewayIp>/apiuser/hello?name=myName&surName=mySurname"

Installing Jenkins using the AGIC
---------------------------------
If you wish to get more adventurous and use Helm, you can try out the Jenkins example by doing the following...

    helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io
    helm repo update
    kubectl create ns logicapp-jenkins
    helm install jenkins jenkins/jenkins -f jenkins-values.yaml
    kubectl get all -n logicapp-jenkins

You will need to wait a bit for everything to deploy and make itself stable (about 5 mins should be enough).

You can then open Jenkins using the IP obtained from...

    ./deploycontroller.sh --getIp
    open http://<gatewayIp>/jenkins

You can optain the password with...

    kubectl exec --namespace logicapp-jenkins -it svc/jenkins -c jenkins -- /bin/cat /run/secrets/chart-admin-password && echo

Cleaning Up
-----------
To clean up the installation, do the following...

    ./deploycontroller.sh -d

This will delete all the items created in your Kubernetes installation.

Notes
-----
- These scripts are only for demo purposes and have not been thoroughly vetted for production use
- The syntax for the controllers given in the Azure documentation and samples is incorrect. It uses the beta IC syntax which is no longer supported. Please use the correct v1 syntax. See this repo for the correct usage
