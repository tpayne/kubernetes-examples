Falco Samples
=============

This repo has a couple of example Kubernetes deployment YAML files that show how to use the
Falco SOAR and SIEM security system.

Dependencies
------------
Before you attempt this example, please ensure you have done the following: -
- You have installed Helm (helm) and the Kubernetes client (kubectl)
- You have logged into a (Unix) terminal window that will allow you to do deployments to a valid K8s cluster
- You have your Kubernetes' context set to a system that you have permission to deploy to
- You have access to an Azure account as an admin (or have permission to create clusters and deployments)

Running the samples
-------------------
To run the samples, please do the following steps.

First, install the Falco...

    ./deployfalco.sh

Cleaning Up
-----------
To clean up the installation, do the following...

    ./deployfalco.sh -d

This will delete all the Falco items created in your Kubernetes installation.
