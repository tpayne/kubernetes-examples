Falco Samples
=============

This repo has a couple of example Kubernetes deployment YAML files that show how to use the
Falco SOAR and SIEM security system.

Dependencies
------------
Before you attempt this example, please ensure you have done the following: -
- You have installed Helm (helm) and the Kubernetes client (kubectl)
- You have logged into a (Unix) terminal window that will allow you to do deployments to a valid K8s cluster
- You have your Kubernetes' context set to a system that you have permission to deploy to
- You have access to an Azure account as an admin (or have permission to create clusters and deployments)

Running the samples
-------------------
To run the samples, please do the following steps.

First, install the Falco (with sidekick and Kubeless)...

    ./deployfalco.sh -s

If you want to install a custom ruleset, you can use...

    ./deployfalco.sh -c -s

Deploying the Kubeless samples, you can do...

    (kubectl apply -n kubeless -f kubeless/ns.yml && \
        kubectl apply -n kubeless -f kubeless/roles.yml && \
        kubectl apply -n kubeless -f kubeless/function.yml)

Cleaning Up
-----------
To clean up the installation, do the following...

    ./deployfalco.sh -d

This will delete all the Falco items created in your Kubernetes installation, although it may have a while.

Notes
-----
As of 15th of Dec, 2021, Kubeless has been archived as a project which means it will no longer be actively maintained by its developers. As such, the tooling no longer works as it should be installations etc. I have worked around this issue to get it to install, but what the behaviour of the product is at the point is up in the air.
