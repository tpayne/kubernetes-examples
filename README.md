Clean Up
--------
After you have finished you can clean up your Docker repo with the following commands...

    docker system df
    docker system prune --all -f
    
Be sure you want to run this command however as it will reclaim all unused space!

Notes
-----
You can merge Kubeconfigs with the following...
    
    export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/new-config-file 
    kubectl config view --flatten
